## Final Project 
**Description:**  
**Checkaroo** is a command-line to-do list manager written in C. It allows users to efficiently track, add, remove, and mark tasks as complete â€” all from the terminal. 
The goal of the project was to create a simple yet functional productivity tool that reinforces file handling, data structures, and user input management in C.

**Features:**  
- Add new tasks, including priortiy and due date 
- Mark tasks as complete or delete them  
- Display all pending and completed tasks  
- Store tasks persistently in a local file
