The listner's audio aura seems upbeat and energetic, it contains lots of musci that has a high danceability.
This suggests that they enjoy must to dance to and which is mainly cheerful.
This would be based off the valence, energy and danceability.
If the values are low, then their aura may be more refelctive or melancholic.


This way of calculating aura misses a couple factors.
Mainly, the number of times a song was played, a song that was played significantly more would be a more accurate
representation of their taste or aura.
I would also say there are some aspect of the music missing on which to judge it, such as lyrics, genre or tempo.
To improve, I would most definitely weight the songs based on the number of plays they have, and incorporate a few
more data points for the songs.
